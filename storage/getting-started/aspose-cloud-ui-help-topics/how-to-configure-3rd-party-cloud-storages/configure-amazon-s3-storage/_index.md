To use Amazon S3 storage, you have to create your own account and create a new bucket at <https://aws.amazon.com/>. Please followÂ [Sign Up for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/SigningUpforS3.html) for more details. You also have to configure Amazon S3 Storage using your Aspose account at <https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/>. Please follow these steps:

- Log in to [https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/.](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/)
- Select **Storages** tab.
- Select **Amazon S3 Storage** from **Create new storage** menu.
- Enter **Storage Name**.
- Enter **AWS access key**.
- Enter **AWS secret key**.
- Optionally enter **Bucket** name.
- Press **Save** button to configure new storage.

The new storage would appear under **My Storage** tab. Now you can use this storage with Aspose REST APIs.
